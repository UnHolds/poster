## Additional Information

The "debugging manifesto" is a poster by Julia Evans[^1], who makes comics explaining tools and topics that are usually not explicitly taught, but very useful.

Since the FAQ on licensing does not explicitly mention the posters as CC-BY-NC-SA, only the free comics, I sent an email to confirm if this usage would be ok and it is!

> Please feel free to print the posters for the community rooms. If you want to send us photos of them once they're up, that would be great too!
